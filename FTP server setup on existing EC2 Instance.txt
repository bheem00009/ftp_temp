To setup FTP server in the instance
===========================

IMPORTANT
---------------
Please take an AMI/Snapshot[1][2] of the instance before performing the steps to have backup of data.
---------------

I tested the below steps in a test Ubuntu instance launched from the same AMI : ami-0123b531fc646552f as the instance : i-0491b8182aadb0439.

IMPORTANT : In the security group associated with the instance, please add rules for ports 20,21 and the ports from 40000-50000 that are going to be configured in the instance.

The steps that I followed in my test instance to setup FTP:

NOTE
-------
I followed all the steps from the following document:

[+] https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-vsftpd-for-a-user-s-directory-on-ubuntu-18-04 
-------

Installing vsftpd
--------------------
$ sudo apt-get update -y
$ sudo apt-get install vsftpd -y


Adding user, permissions, directories
------------------------------------------
NOTE - Please make sure to change the username according to your requirements.

Adding a user:

 $ sudo adduser sammy

Create the ftp folder:

 $ sudo mkdir /home/sammy/ftp

Set its ownership:

 $ sudo chown nobody:nogroup /home/sammy/ftp

Remove write permissions:

 $ sudo chmod a-w /home/sammy/ftp
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-vsftpd-for-a-user-s-directory-on-ubuntu-18-04

Creating directories:

  $ sudo mkdir /home/sammy/ftp/files
  $ sudo chown sammy:sammy /home/sammy/ftp/files

  Verify the permissions:

   $ sudo ls -la /home/sammy/ftp

  Output from my instance:

   $ sudo ls -la /home/sammy/ftp
    total 12
    dr-xr-xr-x 3 nobody nogroup 4096 Jul 15 04:32 .
    drwxr-xr-x 3 sammy  sammy   4096 Jul 15 04:32 ..
    drwxr-xr-x 2 sammy  sammy   4096 Jul 15 04:33 files

Added a test file:

  $ echo "vsftpd test file" | sudo tee /home/sammy/ftp/files/test.txt


Configuring FTP Access
---------------------------
Securing transaction by running the below command:

$ sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem -out /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem

NOTE - Here, for "Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:", please enter the Server's IP.

Adding the user to /etc/vsftpd.userlist

$ echo "sammy" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist

Modified and added the following content in the file /etc/vsftpd.conf:

NOTE - Please create a copy of the original before making changes:
       $ sudo cp /etc/vsftpd.conf /etc/vsftpd.conf.orig

Please make sure to add the below parameters along with the existing parameters in the file.

pasv_enable=YES
anonymous_enable=NO
local_enable=YES
write_enable=YES
chroot_local_user=YES
user_sub_token=$USER
local_root=/home/$USER/ftp
pasv_min_port=40000
pasv_max_port=50000
userlist_enable=YES
userlist_file=/etc/vsftpd.userlist
userlist_deny=NO
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem
ssl_enable=YES
allow_anon_ssl=NO
force_local_data_ssl=YES
force_local_logins_ssl=YES
ssl_tlsv1=YES
ssl_sslv2=NO
ssl_sslv3=NO
require_ssl_reuse=NO
ssl_ciphers=HIGH

After modifying/adding the parameters in the configuration file, I ran the below command to make the changes take effect:

$ sudo systemctl restart vsftpd

Connecting from FileZilla
------------------------------
To download FileZilla for Windows, please refer : https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=win64 

I have provided the same settings as mentioned in the document in Site Manager (File > Site Manager).
I have also attached the screenshot of this for your reference to connect from FileZilla.

I was successfully able to connect from FileZilla to my test instance.

If you are getting timeout using FileZilla, please check if you are connected to VPN. If yes, please disconnect from VPN and try again.

Requesting more information if you face any issues
------------------------------------------------------------
If you are facing any issues connecting using FTP, please share the following details:

1. Files from the instance:
   /etc/vsftpd.conf
   /etc/vsftpd.userlist

2. Any error messages that you are facing. Screenshots will be really helpful


To make use of a secondary interface
-------------------------------------------
I would request you to refer the following article to make the secondary interface work in the Ubuntu instance :

[+] https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-ubuntu-secondary-network-interface/ 

To make use of the secondary interface, please be informed that we would have to perform additional configurations at the OS level and there is a possibility of this affecting your existing configurations.

I would recommend making use of an instance from the same Public AMI as the original instance as I was successfully able to configure FTP for the same.


Meanwhile, if you have any questions/concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out and I will be glad to assist you.

Stay safe and have a great day ahead!
